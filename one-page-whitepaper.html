				"The first generation of the digital revolution brought us the Internet of information. The second
				generation — powered by blockchain technology — is bringing us the Internet of value: a new platform to
				reshape the world of business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better." –
				<em>Don Tapscott</em>

				The global Gaming and Betting industry has been around for years and owing to its attractiveness and growing
				demand, will most probably be around for many more. Gaming and Betting is undeniably confronted with fundamental
				issues, affecting the industry negatively. The issue of trust stands at the forefront, as it affects all aspects
				of the industry from fair gaming, to reputable operators, to the systems that hold customers’ deposits and
				manage their winnings. Without trust people are hesitant to transact with current mechanisms, which are based on
				a model of human intervention that make room for fraud and dishonesty. Imagine a world where the Gaming and
				Betting economy is built on the Blockchain and is run by Smart Contracts. Gron Digital offers exactly that – a
				platform that brings the inherent benefits of trust, transparency and certainty to our economy, presenting
				players with an open and fair alternative to the norm.
			</p>
			<p>
				At present, individuals and technology in the industry, have lacked the ability to solve various challenges the
				domain is regularly confronted with - particularly, the issue of trust and cost. Thus, parties in the industry
				rely on authoritative bodies and regulation to instil the trust, while costs incurred remain high for all
				parties. In order to overcome these concerns, Gron Digital has created a platform which caters for all role
				players, where they can harmoniously co-exist and share the revenues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gron Digital strives to realign the global Gaming and Betting market through reliable and autonomous
				transactions on the Blockchain. This platform will generate an economy among users, which is catered for
				everyone by allowing broad-based participation in the following roles: Game and Application Developers, Bankroll
				& Risk Backers, Service Providers, Operators, Gaming Laboratories and Certifying Authorities, Regulators and
				Players. Gron Digital guarantees its participants an ecosystem which is secure, transparent, autonomous,
				auditable and fair, as transactions are administered by cryptographically verifiable code without human
				intervention. The combined knowledge of our founders’ experience, as well as the existing systems they bring to
				the platform, assures the product’s shorter time-to-market and adaptation to the Blockchain. Gron Digital has
				developed tools and a framework allowing easy application development. This constructor will have modules
				spanning across all the services and processes which are required to run a Gaming and Betting operation.
				Additionally, Gron Digital provides a pool of casino, sports and lottery modules to kick-start the creation of
				custom applications. The GRO is our utility token that will be used on the Platform. The utility token acts as:
				a Gaming and Betting currency, as a reward, a form of payment and incentive which powers the Gron Digital
				economy. Maximum 950 000 000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty million) GRO utility tokens will be issued during the ICO.
				Of these tokens, 60%, which is 570 000 000 (Five Hundred and Seventy million) tokens, will be offered for public
				participation over 4 rounds, with each round lasting for up to 14 days. After all 4 rounds, the Gron Digital ICO
				will close.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gron Digital creates a Platform which merges and connects various parties within this lucrative industry in
				order to ensure continuous growth and prosperity for all. The value proposition, offered to the industry through
				our utility tokens and Protocol, provides the industry with an all-encompassing solution to various issues faced
				by operators, players, developers and regulators today. The future of online Gaming and Betting has never looked
				so extraordinary and exciting.
