			<p>
				A Gambling and Betting Platform where transactions are administered by cryptographically verifiable code with no
				human intervention. Gron Digital is a secure, transparent, auditable and fair Gaming Platform on the Blockchain.
				Our Smart Contracts act as an autonomous trust agent. The Platform is operated by a utility token – called GRO.
				The GRO is used by participants in exchange for value and services they provide. Service providers, bookmakers,
				casino operators, affiliates, regulators and players are a few examples of the participants within the Gron
				Digital eco-system.
