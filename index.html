					<h1>Smart Wallet for Lucrative Industry.</h1>
					<p>
						We do not re-invent the wheel, we simply follow the cash.<br>
						Most businesses think the Blockchain will change the norm or "disrupt" their economy.
						Think again. The reality is 87% of them are fantasizing or simply capitalizing on the trend.
						Their businesses will do just fine without a token and the Blockchain. They are jumping on the
						bandwagon of soon departing train.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gron Wallet is a smart way to solve the problem, which costs the Gambling and Betting industry
						$7.2b per annum.
						The need for Blockchain, Smart Contract and Network Users Incentives mechanism is obvious and
						justified. Hence the introduction of our GRO token.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are not a startup with MVP. We are bringing a multibillion-dollar industry together to combat
						the issue, which to this day everyone is fighting on their own.

			<h2 class="section-header">Industry Problems We Solve</h2>
			<p class="centered dark">
				Common industry problems the Operators (Bookmakers/Casinos online) and Players (the consumers of the services) are faced with.
				Gron Digital has a solution.
			</p>
			<div id="problems">
				<div class="problem-solutions">
					<div class="problem-title">
						<div class="numblurb-number">1</div>
						<h3>Control of funds</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="problems">
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Player's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Players need to have an approved account with every operator to access their funds.
								Withdrawing and depositing funds can be a problem with difficult processes in place
								which interrupts play time in the casino. Who wants to wait a few hours or days for a
								lucky hot offer?
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Operator's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								With no direct access to Player’s Liability Accounts, where collective players funds are
								saved, large payouts become problematic. Is it worth risking your reputation?
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="solution">
						<div class="solution-inner">

						<h4><span class="icon-ok"></span> Gron's Solution</h4>
						<p>
							With Gron Wallet, a player funds the gaming transactions with a choice of options, i.e.
							credit card, bank transfer, crypto exchanges and controls the fund levels at all times.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gron Digital ensures the winnings and gives operators indirect access to a bigger Player's liability
							account by providing a decentralized ledger and Bank Rollers funds. Gron Digital Smart contract ensures
							and controls the tight and verifiable payout of the winnings.
						</p>

						<h3>KYC/FICA and AML process</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="problems">
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Player's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Players playing at more than one casino or sports betting site often need to submit the
								same KYC/FICA documents over and over to each operator.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Operator's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Time-consuming and delayed KYC/FICA administration is something operators want to avoid.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="solution">
						<div class="solution-inner">

						<h4><span class="icon-ok"></span> Gron's Solution</h4>
						<p>
							Gron Digital manages the KYC/FICA process using technology, the Blockchain and third-party
							collection and verifications so that players only need send their details once. Operators
							conditions are fulfilled by getting the right player details, these are provided with
							permission from the player.

						<h3>Winning payouts & Dispute resolution</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="problems">
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Player's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								In some cases, players can experience delays in receiving payouts from trusted smaller
								operators for a number of reasons.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some operators take time to investigate player queries and may request more information
								to process payouts. Getting Regulators involved is the last resort and is no longer
								necessary when the Gron Smart contract is in place. This makes sure that players receive
								their winnings easily.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Operator's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Smaller operators no longer have to battle with cash reserves needed for Player's
								Liability Account. These limitations can cause delays for larger payouts needing
								assistance with lowering entry-level and maximizing cash flow.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="solution">
						<div class="solution-inner">

						<h4><span class="icon-ok"></span> Gron's Solution</h4>
						<p>
							Gron Digital Smart Contract solves both of these problems and acts as an autonomous agent
							utilizing cryptographically verified code executed on the Blockchain so that winnings are
							insured, guaranteed and paid instantly. Let Gron Digital do the work with easy-to-audit and
							transparent transactions.

						<h3>Payment processing</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="problems">
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Player's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Exposure of credit card and identity details to many operators puts a player at high
								risk of being defrauded and not recovering the funds.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Operator's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								High payment solution provider costs, lengthy administration, manual checks and
								chargebacks still happen often, wasting time and money taking away from profits.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="solution">
						<div class="solution-inner">

						<h4><span class="icon-ok"></span> Gron’s Solution</h4>
						<p>
							Gron Digital keeps it simple.  No Chargebacks. Low transaction costs. Instant withdrawals.

						<h3>Bonus abuse and illicit activities</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="problems">
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Player's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Due to the long processes needed to control abusive and illicit activities, honest
								players don’t get to enjoy bonuses and promotions which they deserve.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="problem">
							<h4><span class="icon-attention"></span> Operator's Problem</h4>
							<p>
								Keeping track of player behavior to assist in managing the effects of abuse is important
								as misuse of bonuses and “sure bet” situations continue to be a reality for casinos and
								bookmakers. In most cases, the “learning curve” comes at a high cost to an Operator.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="solution">
						<div class="solution-inner">

						<h4><span class="icon-ok"></span> Gron's Solution</h4>
						<p>
							The Gron Digital platform facilitates the tracking of players with Machine Learning and
							Artificial Intelligence without compromising the privacy of Players. Operators can be
							alerted to unwelcome Players to protect their business from unwanted behavior.

							Regardless of whether you are a bookmaker or a punter, you are always the player. What sets you apart from
