								overcoming legacy issues, and protecting both player and industry from the myriad of challenges that
								impact on its reputation and growth. Currently the gambling and betting market’s reputation is limping
								into the 21st century, held back by problems around fair competition, fair gaming, trusted service
								providers, random number generator and return to player percentages, and pari-mutuel betting.”

								“The man behind an initial coin offering (ICO) expected to launch next month has played down the
								negativity surrounding the use of ICOs and claims his ICO — which aims to tackle legacy issues of trust
								and fair competition in the gambling sector — will be backed by “trusted” experts. In a press release
								today announcing the launch of its pre-ICO to develop an open gaming platform, CEO of Gron Digital Tebogo
								Makamo said ICOs have recently seen plenty of negative press surrounding them as they’ve been “overdone,
								overworked and have often under-delivered.”

								by Gron Digital has been crafted by advisors and trusted partners with extensive gaming and betting
								industry experience. As a result, the platform is specifically targeted with properties built in to
								protect consumers, children, addictive personalities, suppliers and more.”

								“Many people are claiming that the Blockchain will change our lives, but the reality is that it won’t –
								most businesses will run as usual. However, there are areas where this technology can be disruptive and
								the gambling industry provides a good opportunity to prove it. GRO, developed by Gron Digital, is the
								utility token and is coupled with the smart contract. The value can only be transferred from a payer to
								a payee if all conditions of the contract have been met.”
