			<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
			<p>By purchasing ERC20-based GRO Tokens (“Tokens”, “GRO”) from Gron Digital (“Company”) during the Token
				sale (“Token generation event”), you expressly agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth herein
				(“Terms”).</p>
			<p>These Terms govern the sale of the Tokens during the Token generation event, supersede and replace any
				public statements about the Tokens offer made by any third parties.</p>
			<p>Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of
				acquiring the Tokens.</p>
			<p>Ownership of the Tokens gives no rights express or implied, other than the right to use Tokens as payment
				for the Company’s services (“Services”) as facilitated through a platform that the Company is developing
				(the “Gron Digital Platform”). Except as can be decided by the Company’s management at their own
				discretion and/or pursuant to requirements of applicable law or regulation, purchases of the Tokens are
				non-refundable. You should have no expectation of any shareholder, equity, or other interest or any
				influence over governance of the Company, or obtaining any right to receive future revenue shares,
				intellectual property or any other form of participation in the Company, other than the rights relating
				to the provision and receipt of Services.</p>
			<p>Gron Digital (Pty)Ltd is a private company duly incorporated in accordance with the laws of the Republic
				of South Africa. The Company has the full power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and
				perform its obligations in connection with issuance and sale of Tokens as well as providing the Services
				of the Platform for its customers. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its rights
				and obligations would not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of its constituent document
				and/or the laws of the Republic of South Africa. However, the Company cannot guarantee that its
				performance and operations comply with the laws of any other jurisdictions and, therefore, shall not be
				held liable for any breach or violations of such laws.</p>
			
			<h3>WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THE TOKENS IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND
				BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS.</h3>
			<p>Purchases of the Tokens should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have
				significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens,
				like bitcoin (“BTC”), and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should have functional
				understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. The
				Company will not be responsible for lost BTC or the Tokens resulting from actions taken by, or omitted
				by Purchasers. Note, in particular, that you should take great care to write down your wallet password
				and not lose it so as to be sure that you will be able to access your Tokens when it becomes available
				after the end of the Generation Period. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should
				not participate in the acquisition of the Tokens.</p>
			
			<h3>WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE VOLATILITY.</h3>
			<p>Cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets, such as BTC, have demonstrated extreme
				fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. A purchaser of the Tokens should be
				prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of the Tokens denominated in
				ether (ETH). Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply
				and demand. The Company does not guarantee market liquidity for the Tokens and therefore there may be
				periods of time in which the Tokens are difficult to buy. Additionally, due to different regulatory
				dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts
				at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of the Tokens may be markedly different in
				different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies.</p>
			
			<h3>WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF THE TOKENS ENTAILS A NUMBER OF RISKS.</h3>
			<p>The purchase of the Tokens carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing the Tokens, you should
				carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer,
				accountant, and/or tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should
				not purchase the Tokens. By purchasing the Tokens subject to these Terms, and to the extent permitted by
				law, you agree not to hold the Company liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or
				consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the purchase and possession of the
				Tokens, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.</p>
			<p>At any point, if you do not agree to any portion of the Terms, you should not proceed to purchase any
				Tokens.</p>
			<p>You agree to purchase such number of the Tokens as ordered by you on the website www.grondigital.com when
				the Terms are accepted.</p>

			<h2>3. TOKEN SALE TERMS AND SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>3.1</h3>
				<p>Tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the widely-spread
					ERC20 standard.</p>
				<h3>3.2</h3>
				<p>950 000 000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty Million) Tokens are anticipated to be
					issued in a single token creation event, 570 000 000 (Five Hundred and Seventy million) Tokens will
					be offered to public and 380 000 000 (Nine Three Hundred and Eighty Million) Tokens will be held by
					the Company as compensation to the founders, to provide bonus schemes and incentives to the Gron
					Digital team and Bank Roll funds to back the jackpots and lotteries’ main prizes. The Tokens’ price
					may not be equal depending on the round of the Tokens issuance as outlined below. The Company will
					conduct the singleToken creation event on January 9th, 2018 (the “Launch Date”).</p>
				<h3>3.3</h3>
				<p>The Company will form a reserve pool to be construed as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pool for team incentives and bonuses: 114 000 000 (One Hundred and Fourteen million) GRO</li>
					<li>Bank Roll tokens: 152 000 000 (One Hundred and Fifty Two million) GRO</li>
					<li>Founders: 114 000 000 (Hundred and Fourteen million) GRO</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>3.4</h3>
				<p>To acquire Tokens during the Token generation event, you must have a
					suitable tokens wallet established and operational. In particular, you must have: (i) either an
					Ethereum wallet if you wish to purchase Tokens using Ethereum, and (ii) an Ethereum wallet that
					supports the ERC20 token standard in order to receive Tokens that you purchase from the Company.
					Company reserves the right to prescribe additional guidance regarding specific wallet
					requirements.</p>
				<h3>3.5</h3>
				<p>Prior to the Launch Date, the Company will create and deploy an
					Ethereum-based smart contract system (“Smart Contract System”), which creates and maintains a ledger
					that maps Ethereum addresses to Token balances and implements the Ethereum ERC-20 standard.</p>
				<h3>3.6</h3>
				<p>At the Launch Date, the Company will make available a web application to
					facilitate your purchase and receipt of the Tokens. If you wish to purchase the Tokens, you must
					first provide your Ethereum address to the web application as a return address. The Company is
					collecting return addresses so that it may return purchasers’ in the event that unforeseen
					circumstances otherwise cause the Company to decide to not proceed with the sale of the Tokens.
					Second, you will need to provide an Ethereum ERC20 compatible wallet address for the delivery of the
					Tokens you purchase via the Smart Contract System. Company may also request certain optional
					information, such as an email address, through the web interface.</p>
				<h3>3.7</h3>
				<p>The web application will then send you a unique deposit address for Ether.
					Once the unique deposit address has received Ether from you, the Company will authorize the Smart
					Contract System to deliver Tokens to the Ethereum ERC20 wallet address that you provided to the
					Company for delivery of the Tokens.</p>
				<h3>3.8</h3>
				<p>The Company anticipates that delivery of the Tokens from the Smart Contract
					System to purchasers will occur within one hour, but reserves the right to delay delivery up to 24
					hours.</p>
				<h3>3.9</h3>
				<p>Ether proceeds from the Token generation event will be used to compensate
					the Company’s staff, marketing and operational costs as well as development of technical
					infrastructure.</p>
				<h3>3.10</h3>
				<p>You further agree to accept sole and exclusive risk for the purchase of
					the Tokens through www.grondigital.com.</p>
				<h3>3.11</h3>
				<p>In order to reduce the possibility of fraud, phishing attempts and other
					schemes perpetrated by malicious third parties, you agree not to respond directly to any inquiry
					regarding its purchase of the Tokens, including but not limited to email requests purportedly coming
					from the Company and any third parties. You understand that the Company may send the purchaser
					emails from time-to-time, but these email notices will never ask for information or require a
					response from the purchaser.</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<h2>4. CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE TOKENS</h2>
			
			<p>The purchase of the Tokens carries with it significant risks. Prior to purchasing the Tokens, you should
				carefully consider the risks, described below and, to the extent possible, consult a lawyer, accountant,
				and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase the Tokens.</p>
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>4.1</h3>
				<p>The Tokens will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a
					password selected by the purchaser. Not maintaining an accurate record of purchaser’s password, may
					lead to the loss of the Tokens. As a result, purchasers must safely store their password in one or
					more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. In order to access one’s
					Tokens the password that the purchaser entered is required; loss of this may lead to the loss of a
					purchaser’s Tokens.</p>
				<h3>4.2</h3>
				<p>THE PURCHASER MUST NOT RESPOND TO ANY INQUIRY REGARDING THEIR PURCHASE OF
					GRO, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO EMAIL REQUESTS PURPORTEDLY COMING FROM THE GRON DIGITAL WEBSITE OR
					A SIMILAR LOOKING DOMAIN. ANY THIRD PARTY THAT GAINS ACCESS TO PURCHASER’S PURCHASE EMAIL MAY BE
					ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE PURCHASER’S GRO. THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES ANY LIABILITY EXPRESS OR
					IMPLIED LOSS OF TOCKENS IN SUCH CASES.</p>
				<h3>4.3</h3>
				<p>There has been increased regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
					with respect to Cryptocurrencies and token sales. The Company’s operations could be impacted by one
					or more regulatory enquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the
					Company to continue to develop its business.</p>
				<h3>4.4</h3>
				<p>You understand that while the Company’steam will make reasonable efforts to
					complete the Gron Digital Platform, it is possible that a completed version of the Gron Digital
					Platform may not be released and an operational Gron Digital Platform will never be available.</p>
				<h3>4.5</h3>
				<p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the
					cryptocurrency revenue from the token sales process, which attempt if successful may potentially
					impact the ability of the Company to promote the Platform. The Company has and will continue to
					implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the Ether proceeds, however no guarantee
					expressed or implied can be made in this respect.</p>
				<h3>4.6</h3>
				<p>Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of
					quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Gron Digital Platform, which
					among others may result in the theft or loss of the Tokens. To the extent possible, the Company’s
					team intends to update the software protocol underlying the Gron Digital Platform to ward off the
					misuse of such advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it
					cannot predict the future of cryptography or thus guaranty the success of any future security
					updates.</p>
				<h3>4.7</h3>
				<p>As other cryptocurrencies, the Tokens are susceptible to mining attacks,
					including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining”
					attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks may present a significant risk to the
					Company, including without limitation to the expected proper payment operations.</p>
				<h3>4.8</h3>
				<p>The Gron Digital Platform is a new product, which may lead to price
					volatility and uncertainty that could adversely affect the value of the Tokens. The factors
					affecting the further development of the Gron Digital Platform, include: a) continued worldwide use
					of the Tokens; b) government and quasi-government regulation of the Tokens, or restrictions on or
					regulation of access to and operation of the Gron Digital Platform; c) compliance and regulatory
					requirements applicable to the Gron Digital Platform activity and operations conducted thereon; d)
					the maintenance, development and implementation of the software of the Gron Digital Platform; e)
					changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; f) the availability and
					popularity of other similar products; and g) general economic conditions and applicable regulatory
					environment.</p>
				<h3>4.9</h3>
				<p>IP rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the Gron Digital
					Platform. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened
					action may reduce confidence in the Gron Digital Platform’s long-term viability. Additionally, a
					meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent end-users from accessing the Gron Digital
					Platform or holding or transferring their Tokens.</p>
				<h3>4.10</h3>
				<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges on which the Tokens may trade are relatively new
					and largely unregulated and may therefore be exposed to fraud and failure in a greater extent than
					established, regulated exchanges for other products. To the extent that the cryptocurrency exchanges
					representing a substantial portion of the volume in Tokens trading are involved in fraud or
					experience security failures or other operational issues, such cryptocurrency exchange failures may
					result in a reduction in the price and can adversely affect the value of the GRO. A lack of
					stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency
					exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may
					result in greater price volatility.</p>
				<h3>4.11</h3>
				<p>The Company’s services may be utilized by unwanted and illegal elements to
					further their illegal motives. In order to prevent this the Company intends to introduce
					Know-Your-Client, due diligence and anti-fraud polices and procedures.</p>
				<h3>4.12</h3>
				<p>Political or economic crises may trigger large-scale sales of the Tokens,
					which may lead to a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of the Tokens. Digital
					assets such as the Tokens, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based
					upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of transacting, and it is unclear how
					such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events</p>
				<h3>4.13</h3>
				<p>The Tokens transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly
					transferred Tokens are generally irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed Tokens
					transactions could adversely affect the value of the Tokens. Without the consent and active
					participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of
					the processing power on the host blockchain platform cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an
					administrative perspective, reversible. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block
					that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of the Tokens or a theft of the Tokens
					generally will not be reversible and there may be no compensation for any such transfer or theft.
					Such loss could adversely affect the value of the Tokens. Any malfunction or unexpected functioning
					of the Ethereum blockchain may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold the
					Tokens. Such impact could adversely affect the value of the Tokens.</p>
				<h3>4.14</h3>
				<p>Due to any number of reasons, including without limitation the failure of
					business relationships or marketing strategies, that the Company and all subsequent marketing from
					the money raised from the sale of the Tokens may fail to achieve success.</p>
				<h3>4.15</h3>
				<p>Purchasers shall be eligible to purchase the Tokens subject to applicable
					legislative and regulatory restrictions and prohibitions in their respective jurisdictions. The
					Company shall refuse selling Tokens to residents of the jurisdictions specified in clauses 2.11-2.12
					of the Terms and may refuse selling them to other ineligible countries’ residents subject to local
					restrictions and prohibitions. The Company shall not be held liable should an ineligible purchaser
					acquire the Tokens by any means.</p>
				<h3>4.16</h3>
				<p>Personal information received from the Token holders and the information
					about the number of tokens holders serviced by the Company, the wallet addresses used, and any other
					relevant information may be disclosed to law enforcement, government officials, and other third
					parties when the Company is required to disclose such information by law, subpoena, or court order.
					The Company shall at no time be held responsible for such information disclosure.</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<h2>5. TAXATION OF TOKENS</h2>
			<p>The Company makes no representations about the tax implications of the sale of the Tokens or the
				possession or use of the Tokens. The purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the
				purchase of the Tokens or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Tokens over
				time has tax implications for the purchaser in the purchaser’s home jurisdiction. By purchasing the
				Tokens, and to the extent permitted by law, the purchaser agrees not to hold the Company liable for any
				tax liability of the purchaser associated with or arising from the purchase of the Tokens.</p>
			
			
			<h2>6. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. WAIVER</h2>
			<p>THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
				DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR
				RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, TOKENS OR THE PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF
				ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF
				CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY
				INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
				GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR PURCHASE OF,
				OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE, GRO. THE PURCHASER FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT
				LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER PURCHASERS OF TOKENS, AND THAT THE RISK OF
				PURCHASING TOKENS RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE PURCHASER. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS,
				UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE TO ANY PURCHASER FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT THE
				PURCHASER MAY HAVE PAID FOR THE PURCHASE OF GRO. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
				CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE,
				SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY TO A PURCHASER.
				IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY PURCHASER OR EXCLUDE
				DAMAGE ARISING FROM ANY WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF THE COMPANY.</p>
			
			
			<h2>7. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>7.1</h3>
				<p>These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
					with the laws of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
				<h3>7.2</h3>
				<p>Each party agrees for the benefit of the other, but without prejudice to
					the right of any party to take any proceedings in relation hereto before any other court of
					competent jurisdiction that the courts of the Republic of South Africa shall have jurisdiction to
					hear and determine any suit, action or proceeding, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out
					of or in connection with these Terms and any Instructions given hereunder and, for such purposes,
					irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
				<h3>7.3</h3>
				<p>Each party further irrevocably waives any objection which it may have or be
					entitled to claim at any time to the commencement of any such suit, action or proceeding before such
					courts, or that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, or to
					the enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof over any of its assets or property in any
					jurisdiction.</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<h2>8. SEVERABILITY</h2>
			<p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term,
				clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or
				enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or
				provision of these Terms.</p>
