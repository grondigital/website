			<h2>1. Abstract</h2>

			<p>Global Gaming and Betting has been around for hundreds of years and will be around for many more owing to
				the attractiveness of the industry - the glitz, glamour and excitement of it all!</p>

			<p>Despite this, there are fundamental issues which need to be confronted and which have limited growth of
				the sector. By utilising blockchain technology in unique and sophisticated ways, the Gron Digital
				platform aims to provide pioneering capabilities that will attract new players and improve the
				experience for existing ones, thereby growing the market for gaming services. We believe that this new
				functionality will facilitate substantial disruption within the online betting community, to such an
				extent that the Gron Digital platform will become the preferred business partner to operators and
				suppliers the world over. We will achieve this by building relationships and sharing competitive
				advantages to all users of this innovative new marketplace.</p>

			<p>As is the case with many gaming ICO’s, this conceptual whitepaper captures the prospect of improving
				integrity and fairness within gaming by providing assurances to all role players that transactions on
				the Blockchain Platform are transparent, reliable, and autonomous. However, this is only the beginning,
				as the distributed ledger also creates unique opportunities to broaden the scope of the offering with
				the accumulation of valuable business intelligence. This information will be complied with the help of
				sophisticated data mining tools and AI (Artificial Intelligence) and will enhance product offerings by
				improving understanding of the customer base and targeting their needs in a precise manner.</p>

			<p>The paper will establish how Gron Digital will create a technology platform which will solve historical
				relationship blockages by revealing detailed evidence of the nature and behaviour of the gaming
				community. This will enable new levels of trust and interconnected understanding among users and service
				providers and will enhance broad based participation in the following roles:</p>

			<!-- TODO: Fig 1 : The Gron Digital Gaming Community -->
			
			
			<h2>2. Introduction</h2>

			<p>The size of the regulated global online Gaming and Betting market was $45.86 billion in 2016. Forecasts
				indicate an increase of up to $56.05 billion by 2018. There is no solid data regarding the size of the
				illegal market however it is estimated at around $200 - $400 billion annually, four to ten times bigger.
				The relative size of the ‘illegitimate’ and unlicensed betting activity perpetuates the negative
				connotations as governments attempt to regulate and tax the industry. However, help is at hand and there
				is a general consensus that the decentralised nature and immutability of transactions through blockchain
				technology will revolutionise the industry by forcing rogue and underground online casinos to legitimise
				their operations. The industry is ripe for a rehabilitation as human rights and consumer protection
				controls become more feasible with the advent of new methods of doing business.</p>

			<p>It is acknowledged that Gron Digital will not be the first to market with the concept of enhancing
				fairness and trust in the gaming sector with the use of blockchain technology. However, we believe we
				will be first to utilise Smart Contracts across the gaming value chain in a unique way to ensure that
				useful data is gathered and stored which can be unearthed to provide a better understanding of the
				marketplace and the drivers associated with it. A Smart Contract within the Ethereum environment is a
				self-executing agreement which requires no user intervention, whereby the agreed terms of the contract
				between the parties are directly written into lines of immutable code.</p>

			<p>This means that transactions between parties happen automatically and under predetermined rules and
				regulations which cannot be circumvented. It also means that by bolting on a second layer of protocol,
				these transactions are recorded in real time along with metadata that records parameters associated with
				the parties to the transactions to create a database of the counterparties to the transactions and their
				actions. This database is key to understanding the value proposition that Gron Digital brings to the
				marketplace as it will be instrumental in the design of a comprehensive affiliate or loyalty scheme
				within the GRO token community. The database will also become an extremely valuable resource for
				operators and suppliers to understand their target markets. This will give them an edge over their
				competitors as it will allow them to refine their service offering based on user demographics and
				statistics. It will also give Gron Digital a sustainable revenue stream as the information will only be
				available to subscribers to the service. More about this later.</p>

			<p>This platform will therefore not only bring the inherent benefits of trust, transparency and certainty to
				our sub-economy but will also improve the modes of doing business, making them more efficient and
				accessible to game providers.</p>

			<p>This paper will explore the proposed platform from a number of perspectives. Firstly, it aims to identify
				the major problems associated with groups of stakeholders and to highlight the solutions that the Gron
				Digital Platform will provide. Thereafter the paper will explore the features of our system, which
				includes our development capabilities to design generic tools and applications for gaming platforms
				(Dapps), as well as the value added services that we will feed into the network. The Gron Protocol uses
				a utility crypto-token called GRO. GROs are used as a currency for transacting and as an incentive and
				reward mechanism for all contributors to the platform.</p>

			<h2>4. Players - Problem Statement and Solutions</h2>

			<!-- TODO: image -->

			<p>There are many factors that affect the Gaming and Betting industry negatively. At the forefront, it is
				the issue of trust. Without trust people are hesitant to transact. Trust affects all aspects of the
				industry from fair games to reputable operators, to the systems that hold customer’s deposits and manage
				their winnings. Current mechanisms are based on a model of human intervention and control, which is
				ineffective in preventing fraud and dishonesty.</p>

			<p>Primarily, the Gron Digital mission is undoubtedly to address the concerns of players and improve their
				experience online. We firmly believe that a sizeable pool of untapped potential players exist that are
				hesitant to enter the market for fear of being fleeced. There is a trust deficit created which has
				arisen from the proliferation of illegal and unsavoury industry operators. This undesirable reputation
				has been difficult to shed because it is not only perceived – it is the reality. In truth, the World
				Wide Web of gambling is littered with dangers and pitfalls for the unwary traveller. Many players have
				lost large sums of money unwittingly and with no recourse to law enforcement.</p>

			<p>Clearly, this negative sentiment is hampering the growth of the industry. It is widely recognised that
				the online betting industry is an ideal candidate to benefit from blockchain technology due to the
				dispersed nature of the market. This scattered propagation of internet-based gaming is easier to manage
				with a similarly widespread P2P (peer to peer) operating environment.</p>

			<p>Consequently, we believe that this broad category of disruption will be pervasive throughout the online
				betting environment and there will not be sufficient capacity amongst blockchain gaming platforms to
				cater for the migration of existing service providers to the technology. This leads us to believe that
				more than one blockchain platform will be successful and there will be more than enough business to go
				around. Blockchain gaming platforms will enter a boom market with significant windfalls to be generated
				in the medium term. By providing solutions to player concerns, all industry stakeholders will benefit in
				turn. This growth in players will surely lead to a concomitant proliferation of betting service
				providers and developers.</p>

			<p>We refer to this suite of industry technological interventions addressing legitimacy issues as the
				Generic Player Solutions Package (GPSP). Many of the Gron Digital competitors will be offering a GPSP in
				one form or another, and gambling on the blockchain will become bespoke in cleaning up the industry. The
				potential for widespread improvement in the sector through GPSPs is evident in the success of recent
				gaming ICOs and in time more will be brought to market.</p>

			<p>Importantly though and in addition to the above, Gron Digital will also offer a Specific Player Solutions
				Package (SPSP). This is a set of solutions and improvements that is unique to our product offering. It
				is what differentiates us from our competitors and can be broadly defined as</p>

			<p><em>‘the creation of an artificially intelligent database generated by in-house developed smart contracts
				on an encrypted layer above the blockchain from the dispersed audit trail of gaming transactions that
				will be utilised to improve online gaming service offerings across the Gron Digital marketplace’.</em></p>

			<p>The paper will expand on GPSP and SPSP functionality below.</p>

			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>4.1 Generic Players Solutions Package (GPSP)</h3>
				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

				<div class="content-subsection">
					<h3>4.1.1 Deposits  and  Withdrawals</h3>

					<p>When players join a game for the first time they are required to make a deposit into their gaming
						account. The depositor often uses their credit card details to make these deposits which exposes
						them to credit card fraud. The deposit is controlled by a third party and often takes time to
						reflect or sometimes fails to reflect at all.</p>

					<p>How does the player know their money is safe? If the operator absconds or ceases trading, there
						is the possibility of a total irrecoverable loss of funds. Withdrawals are another issue which
						players are confronted with. These are often administered manually and are only allowed above a
						certain minimum threshold and can incur substantial fees. Turnover clauses for bonuses and
						promotions, Gaming and Betting Tax, as well as reliance on third party systems for transacting
						on these networks, all present areas where trust and efficiency are essential for commercial
						relationships to flourish. Payment Solution Providers (PSP’s) charge the operators exorbitant
						transaction costs of up to 6% resulting in excessive chargebacks.</p>

					<p>So far, the crypto-solution to these difficulties is usually one of two alternatives. Some
						blockchain gaming platforms simply refer to the transparency of the distributed ledger as proof
						of transactions. While this does create a valid audit trail, it does not improve the credit
						worthiness of the operator or reverse past theft. Other crypto-platforms propose a system in
						which players transact directly from their token wallet. This alleviates the need for deposits
						and withdrawals to the operator but this betting wallet will invariably be off the blockchain
						(due to processing speed and gas constraints) and therefore simply shifts the risk of loss from
						the operator to the blockchain platform.</p>

					<p>Gron Digital has developed a more advanced solution, based on a cold-storage supported credit
						line or escrow facility that will be discussed in the Specific Player Solutions Package
						below.</p>

					<h3>4.1.2 Fair  Games (No Cheating)</h3>

					<p>Are online games truly random and products impartial? Will all players be treated equally,
						ethically and professionally?</p>

					<p>From a development and software providers perspective, Gaming and Betting products have not
						evolved significantly in the last decade. Besides the considerable cost of product development,
						companies must ensure that Gaming Laboratories certify that their games conform to fair gaming
						practice before they enter the market. The laboratories work within a strict framework that may
						hinder the creativity of game developers. Additionally, the code and logic of these systems
						involve the intellectual property of the developer or system providers, which is often a close
						guarded secret. Game logic is programmed into the software, machine or a table (physical or
						online) and is the intellectual property of the gaming manufacturer. Players are therefore still
						obliged to trust the developers, their games and systems, alongside the Gaming Laboratory.</p>

					<p>Two important areas of verification when it comes to online gaming are as follows:</p>

					<div class="content-subsection">
						<h3>4.1.2.1  Random  Number  Generation (RNG)</h3>

						<p>The fairness of any game is dependent on a Random Number Generator (RNG). A simple example of
							an RNG at work is a lottery. Lottery participants are forced to trust that the software code
							or physical device generating the winning numbers is truly random. Without such a system
							there will be an element of predictability and possible manipulation when players submit
							their winning numbers.</p>

						<p>However, all RNG’s are not made equally and randomness is seldom absolute. Most commonly,
							pseudo RNG’s utilise computer processors to generate the random numbers but to unequivocally
							ensure that no player can guess the outcome of the next slot or reel stop, physical or real
							RNG’s use lasers to create binary code that is interpreted in a haphazard manner.</p>

						<h3>4.1.2.2 Pari-mutuel Betting (Pool Betting)</h3>

						<p>The issue of Pari-mutuel betting differs from fixed-odds betting in that the final pay-out is
							only determined once the pool is closed, whereas in fixed-odds betting, the pay-out is
							agreed on once the bet is placed. Essentially, this may diminish trust among players as the
							pay-out is calculated by a third party based on a pool sharing arrangement amongst all the
							winning bets. The pari-mutuel betting system therefore requires an element of honest
							intervention after the fact, which raises concerns of possible fixing and a lack of
							transparency. </p>

					</div>

				</div>

				<p>The fundamental problem in the world of Gaming and Betting is rooted deeper than the question of
					randomness. The concern is that the game’s logic and Return To Player (RTP) percentages are in
					interfered with to the benefit of the house.</p>

				<p>This is perhaps the biggest benefit that blockchain offers to the online gaming industry. Most
					blockchain gaming whitepapers will refer to the transparency of the distributed ledger and the fact
					that individual bets can be vetted and checked for fairness. However, it is not always clear how
					this will be achieved since the chain will not record odds and results and it also requires a global
					view of online casinos and gaming platforms over time. While it is theoretically possible for
					players to verify that RNG, RTP and pari-mutuel bets are conducted fairly, without the processing
					power of the network of computers on the blockchain, it is difficult to envision how this will be
					practically achieved.</p>

				<p>This is where Gron Digital’s technology and ongoing telemetric capabilities will be instrumental in
					analysing vast amounts of data to produce trends and statistics via a broad-based incentive
					programme and the use of Smart Contracts and AI (Artificial Intelligence).</p>
				
				<h3>4.2 Specific Players Solutions Package (SPSP)</h3>
				<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				<div class="content-subsection">
					<h3>4.2.1  Operator Verification</h3>

					<p>The need to ensure that games are fair and deposits safe, is also related to the requirement of
						ensuring that service providers are legitimate, licensed and approved by a regulator somewhere
						in the world. In a similar fashion, operators need to ensure that players are legitimate too. It
						is therefore a two-way street and we refer to this as bi-directional counterparty risk
						mitigation. To our knowledge, Gron Digital is the first and only gaming platform that will
						perform identity checks via the blockchain on all stakeholders to verify their bona fides. We
						will partner with secure blockchain identity platforms such as Civic.com to satisfy KYC, FICA
						and AML requirements and ensure that online casinos operate within the law. This will reduce the
						burden of proof as compliance will only happen once but will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
						The fact that an operator is legitimate today does not mean that he will be tomorrow.</p>

					<p>Players will have the peace of mind and certainty that the operators within the Gron Digital
						community are licensed, compliant with all gaming regulations in the jurisdiction of
						registration and continue to operate within the codes of conduct and ethics as required by the
						gaming community. Any operators that do not adhere to these requirements will be subject to
						intervention procedures including remedy timeframes and reporting frameworks. (See Operator
						Solutions Packages below for more information about Player Verification).</p>

					<p>In addition to identity confirmations, Gron Digital will, through its platform operator tools and
						market intelligence, reduce barriers to entry for new operators to diversify the market and
						reduce monopolistic tendencies. A monopoly is characterized by the absence of competition, an
						oligopoly by cartels and reduced competition. This means that powerful industry leaders can
						initiate high costs for consumers, inferior products, and often corrupt behaviour, which leads
						individuals to develop a degree of distrust.</p>

					<p>The effect is that these gaming conglomerates gain greater control within the Gaming and Betting
						sphere by impeding new entrants into the industry and by discriminating and inhibiting
						experimentation or new product development. Furthermore, financial barriers, which include the
						cost of entry for new operators and the costs associated with compliance, are more accessible by
						monopolistic giants. By joining the Gron Digital community, new entrants and smaller online
						platforms will be protected from these cartels and will enjoy lower initial investment
						requirements, faster start-up times and ongoing compliance support.</p>

					<h3>4.2.2  Credit Line/ Escrow</h3>

					<p>As discussed in the Withdrawals and Deposits section above, players want the peace of mind to
						know that their initial investment and subsequent winnings are safe in the custody of the
						operator. This risk will be addressed, in varying degrees, by most blockchain gaming platforms.
						However, players would also like to ensure that the processes involved with funding their gaming
						does not inhibit or slow down their playing and they would like their liquidity to be
						transferrable across websites, games and operators.</p>

					<p>For this reason, Gron Digital is developing a ‘player escrow or credit line capability’ via Smart
						Contracts whereby each player will operate a centralised pre-authorised cold storage backed
						wallet that operates within a set of individual player preferences. This will allow the player
						to enjoy any game within the Gron Digital community immediately in real time with a
						predetermined small float balance that is more manageable and thus less risky than their
						crypto-wallet. In addition, transfer of winnings will be instant and guaranteed as a result of
						the seamless interface between the operator’s platform and Gron Digital. This handy float will
						automatically roll once funds are depleted based on the global settings specified in advance by
						the player (chips transfer limit). This will alleviate unnecessary delays while simultaneously
						ensuring that players do not overextend themselves across multiple games by keeping abreast of
						their consolidated expenditure patterns. The account will also be encrypted and imbued with the
						latest security conventions giving the owner peace of mind that their funds are safe and
						secure.</p>

					<p>In summary, the Gron Digital Bank Roll will result in:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Additional security;</li>
						<li>Shorter transaction turnaround times (11- 15 seconds);</li>
						<li>No chargebacks;</li>
						<li>Low transaction costs;</li>
						<li>Instant reflection of winnings and withdrawals;</li>
						<li>Compatibility across gaming platforms;</li>
						<li>Cryptographically verified code.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>An added advantage arises with the centralised funds repository in that it enables the scrutiny
						of universal spending trends and player behaviour patterns, linked to their identity, which
						triggers the awarding of incentives and results in useful business intelligence.</p>

					<h3>4.2.3  Loyalty Programme and Incentives</h3>

					<p>The gaming industry is highly competitive and notoriously fickle. Almost every operator offers
						players a gamut of affiliate incentives and bonuses to attract new players and retain existing
						ones. These marketing strategies are often effective for a limited time on an individual basis
						but the collective Gron Digital marketplace and the database that will be amassed on players
						across games and operators, affords the platform the opportunity for powerful customer retention
						campaigns across game offerings, devices and content providers.</p>

					<p>This will be done in the form of a consolidated, community wide, Gron Digital branded, Loyalty
						and Affiliate Programme to recognise and endorse beneficial player behaviour over an extended
						period of time. The status of players will improve as they play and they will be promoted in
						relative rank thereby earning additional GRO tokens as their cumulative expenditure increases
						within the community. This will ensure that all operators within the GRO marketplace will
						benefit from the efforts of their peers and improve the recognition and popularity of the
						collective.</p>

					<p>The obvious benefits of a generous loyalty and recognition programme is evident in resorts and
						casinos such as in Las Vegas where players are treated to aspirational service and accommodation
						upgrades and exclusive entertainment invitations depending on their importance to the casino
						owners. We foresee that the Gron Digital Loyalty and Affiliate Programme will become an
						enormously powerful tool for client attraction and absorption and, over time, will incorporate a
						number of strategic industry partners that will provide benefits and preferential treatment to
						promote their own services within the community. This is expected to result in a lucrative
						revenue stream for the business. Inevitably, by attracting players the loyalty program will also
						attract operators and suppliers to the exclusive market.</p>

				</div>

				<p>The powerful information gathered by these initiatives will be market leading but it is important
					that it does not lead to unintended consequences in a notoriously competitive industry. Therefore,
					while players’ identities will be known and verified and they will maintain an individual presence
					on the Gron Digital platform, privacy will be protected, ownership of the information will not pass
					and it will not be held centrally, instead it will be cryptographically distributed across the
					blockchain. In addition, details of individual players will not be shared with operators and
					bookmakers without the express permission of the player, to avoid poaching of customers and identity
					fraud. Operators and suppliers will be rewarded for bringing new players into the community and will
					be given access to broad statistics, trends and data that can be utilised to improve their offering
					on a global basis.</p>

				<p>In summary, player problems have existed for a long time and have worsened as the industry becomes
					more vulnerable to hackers and internet fraudsters. Traditional industry technologies have lacked
					the ability to solve the abovementioned problems, particularly the issue of trust and cost. Thus,
					parties in the industry rely on authoritative bodies and regulation to instil the trust, while costs
					incurred remain high for all parties. In order to overcome these concerns, Gron Digital offers a
					platform which caters for generic solutions to bring together all role players, who can harmoniously
					co-exist and share the revenues.</p>

				<p>But in addition, we will provide a basket of new and ground-breaking specific player solutions to
					enhance the player experience and grow the universe of regular players. This will offer an
					innovative eco-system that is transparent and trustworthy, but also profitable and market
					leading.</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<h2>5. Operator Solutions</h2>

			<!-- TODO: image -->

			<p>Operators can be individuals or existing companies, providing games and betting products within the ambit
				of the law and within a particular jurisdiction, who intend to move to the Blockchain or become a
				start-up by initiating an operation on the Blockchain.</p>

			<p>Existing operators who are looking to move to the Blockchain for the inherent benefits will still have
				regulations to comply with. As mentioned in the Player section above, our Smart Contracts and identity
				verification partners will accommodate various compliance criteria such as:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>License verification;</li>
				<li>Tax compliance;</li>
				<li>KYC and dispute resolution;</li>
				<li>Credit worthiness.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Gron Digital will provide a set of pre-built modules for operators that will cover all aspects of Gaming
				and Betting operations. Using our tools and framework, developers and companies will be able to assemble
				a selection of bolt-on components and build their own custom applications. Additionally, Gron Digital
				will encompass a provision for external development of modules by the community. Operators will be able
				to use our tools to assemble modules that will suit their needs. This will allow them to operate
				effectively on the Platform and open up the industry to fair competition, fostering higher standards and
				greater variety for the players.</p>

			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>5.1 Player Verification</h3>

				<p>In much the same way that there are unscrupulous operators, there are also dishonest players. These
					users, sometimes bots, take advantage of individual bonus schemes and rewards by creating fake
					profiles, duplicating profiles or stealing identities. In addition, hackers and cyber-thieves use
					player profiles to gain access to the platform in order to steal user information, credit card
					information and wallet details. As a result of this, operators frequently have to set up and staff
					separate departments to tackle abusive players. ‘Sure bet’ situations are the biggest problem that
					bookmakers are faced with in the modern sports betting online environment.</p>

				<p>To address this without divulging the identity of individual players, Gron Digital will provide
					legitimate operators with confirmation that each profile represents a real person, in an
					unauthorised location, that is not underaged or otherwise precluded from playing. In addition, we
					will certify that the player is not a ‘politically exposed person’ or a ‘person of interest’
					according to UN standards and is not suspected of money laundering or other fraudulent activity as
					defined by KYC and FICA standards.</p>

				<p>This information will be invaluable to operators to minimise scams, reduce operating costs, and
					demonstrate that they are functioning ethically and responsibly within the ambit of the law.</p>

				<h3>5.2 Player Analytics</h3>

				<p>By being an active member of the Gron Digital token community and a subscriber to the service,
					operators will qualify for regular access to the results of statistical analysis generated from the
					gaming database. This information will be comprehensive and include segmental reporting of the
					profiles of players, their demographics (such as age and gender), user and betting patterns and
					behaviour, game preferences, average wallet sizes and much more. Notwithstanding this, individual
					operators will not be privy to confidential and commercially sensitive information related to their
					competitors and other operators in the market.</p>

				<p>Accurate market intelligence and constant feedback able to establish trends over time as well as
					reactions to marketing campaigns, rewards and product offerings will stand the operators in good
					stead to compete effectively against non Gron Digital competitors and to tailor make and refine
					their product offerings to suit their client base, thereby maximising sales activity and
					profitability within the bounds of transparent RTP parameters. Operators will be able to use this
					information to streamline their advertising budgets, focus their efforts and avoid expensive or
					unsuccessful marketing campaigns.</p>

				<p>This will be done in much the same way as Relationship Marketing Hubs such as Optimove, which are
					able to strategically understand their customers’ needs and wants through predictive models,
					interact with these customers by creating emotionally intelligent communications across channels in
					real time thereby improving customer metrics to maximise conversions, customer spend and churn.</p>

				<p>As the historical information grows and research techniques become more sophisticated, it is
					envisaged that Gron Digital will be in a position to perfect player profiling with a view to
					creating comparisons and commonalities in much the same way as Facebook Lookalike Audiences. This
					will afford operators innovative techniques for reaching new audiences who are more likely to be
					interested in their particular product offering.</p>

				<h3>5.3 Liability Insurance</h3>

				<p>The odds within a betting platform or game are carefully managed to produce a predictable return to
					player and sustainable house edge over the longer term. Operators are required to create and report
					on their Player’s Liability Account which is effectively their surplus funds. The balance on this
					account is utilised by the operator to cover any pay-outs and winnings that arise. Online casinos,
					lotteries and sports betting platforms that have not been operating for a long time have not yet
					built up sufficient reserves in their Liability Account to cater for extraordinary eventualities.
					For instance, if a large jackpot, lottery pay-out or high stakes sports result were to happen, there
					is the possibility that the operator does not have sufficient funds to cover it and will be forced
					out of business. </p>

				<p>To address this problem Gron Digital will provide new operators with pooled pay-out insurance which
					will be denominated in GRO but also credit enhanced. The pool will either backed by fiat currency,
					underwritten by an AAA rated insurance company/cell captive or supported by creditworthy
					bankrollers. This insurance will attract a minimal premium from operators since the quantum of the
					bond will be actuarially calculated after taking into account collective operator liquid assets, the
					hedging effect of opposite and reversing positions and diversification.</p>

				<p>At present, many fledgling operators are unable to afford this kind of risk cover in their individual
					capacity and therefore the mitigation that this service will bring will simultaneously reduce the
					cost of doing business as well as lower the barriers to entry into the gaming market thereby
					bolstering organic growth within the sector. In addition, the insurance will prevent player losses
					as a result of winnings pay-outs not being honoured.</p>

				<h3>5.4 Loyalty Programme and Incentives</h3>

				<p>It is important that all role players receive some economic incentive for their participation on our
					platform. To enable this, all transactions are based on our utility token called GRO. All bets are
					placed in GRO, all winnings are paid out in GRO as well as any kind of development, bonus, incentive
					and fee rewards are paid in GRO. Broad-based participation is crucial to the success of any economy.
					Several participants have been identified by the Gron Digital team in the creation of our
					eco-system. In the post MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stages we may find the need to include
					additional roles.</p>

				<p>By incentivising the players, operators will benefit from the Gron Digital Loyalty and Affiliate
					Programme to attract and retain users with the marketplace. Operators will be able to dovetail their
					own incentives to compliment the global Loyalty and Affiliate Programme and will be in a position to
					forge specific alliances with other operators or create white label operations with relative
					certainty that an existing customer base is available to support any new initiatives or expansion
					activities.</p>

				<h3>5.5 Distributed Application (Dapp) Developers</h3>

				<p>Development, in a broad sense, includes Gron Digital or any third-party contributor who develops a
					functional game or service available to our platform. This could be anything from a unique casino
					game to a pool betting management service. It could also include outsourced development of custom
					applications for operators who prefer professionals to build their systems for them.</p>

				<p>Gron Digital developers will be available to the operating community to assist in interfacing Dapps
					with the platform and with suppliers, linking data, providing customisation and facilitating
					innovation.</p>

			</div>
			
			
			<h2>6. Supplier Solutions</h2>

			<!-- TODO: image -->

			<p>Suppliers comprise game manufacturers or developers that build the technology and systems underlying
				gaming products. Typically, they do not operate the products themselves but supply their functional
				software and data services to recognised gaming brands and white label operators in exchange for a share
				of the revenue. Front end platforms, which are customised for different user groups and regions, enter
				into contracts with suppliers to provide gaming functionality, odds, results and other services often
				via online servers or cloud solutions. CDP Gaming, in the Gron Digital stable, is an example of a gaming
				developer and supplier.</p>

			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>6.1 Operator Analytics</h3>

				<p>Suppliers and developers that are affiliated to the Gron Digital community and utilise GRO tokens to
					transact within marketplace, will also benefit from the market information generated by the platform
					in exchange for a subscription fee. By being privy to the usage trends and statistics of individual
					games across operators they will be able to gauge how well their products are received in the
					market, which products are trending and therefore which areas of R&D are likely to be the most
					successful.</p>

				<h3>6.2 Business Automation</h3>

				<p>The Gron Digital platform will facilitate the interface between suppliers and the operators that use
					their service in a seamless manner. Server or cloud-based transactions will be facilitated on the
					Gron Digital platform via the second layer network to create the seamless and efficient sharing of
					information. Given the revenue sharing arrangement, it is important to suppliers that operators
					report on their operations in an honest, accurate and timeous manner.</p>

			</div>

			<h2>7. Other Role Player Solutions</h2>
			<p>The industry relies on several services in order to operate efficiently, these include the providers
				of:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fixtures and Events;</li>
				<li>Odds;</li>
				<li>Results</li>
				<li>Statistics;</li>
				<li>RNG;</li>
				<li>Line-makers.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>7.1   Scouts & Resulters</h3>

				<p>Scouts are reward seekers. These are individuals who attend live events and provide the latest
					information in real time to the network. There can be many Scouts at one event, who all report
					results into the network. This is a critical part of the platform, they need to be from a reliable
					source, highly accurate, verifiable and received quickly.</p>

				<p>Gron Digital will provide a mobile application with the functionality needed to perform these tasks.
					This Scouts App will feed individual results into the blockchain along with the Scouts Proof of
					Stake commitment. As soon as the information is verified by real time consensus on the chain, it
					will be distributed throughout the Gron Digital network to be accessed by all relevant operators and
					suppliers. Scouts and Resulters will then be rewarded through the GRO Loyalty Programme and will
					receive tokens that can be used within the marketplace or liquidated through a crypto exchange.</p>

				<h3>7.2</h3>

				<p>Driving quality traffic to a Gaming and Betting website is key for a successful online operation.
					Well-structured affiliate programs can assist operators in achieving their sales goals. Common
					industry practice involve once off introduction fees, Gron Digital aims to deviate from this
					conventional system, by compensating Referrers within the Loyalty and Affiliate Programme. By
					linking this to the gaming database we will ensure continuity throughout the Life-Time-Value of the
					Players referred.</p>

				<h3>7.3</h3>

				<p>Bankroll and Risk Backers can be individuals or entities acting bilaterally, or different parties
					combining resources into one Smart Contract. Their typical role is to provide the initial bounty
					used to subsidise games by coupling their utility tokens to a contract for a reward. They can back
					jackpot prizes or bonus offers on a big sporting event, lotteries and various other high stakes
					games. They are willing to expose themselves to high risk for a reward.</p>

				<p>Because the Gron Digital marketplace allows for collaboration and pooling between various role
					players, it will be possible for backers to provide risk mitigation for a group of operators
					simultaneously, to bankroll the Gron Digital Liability Insurance pool, or cover high risk
					eventualities in innovative and flexible ways.</p>

				<h3>7.4</h3>

				<p>The aim of a regulated Gaming and Betting industry is to ensure that all the role players involved in
					any gambling activities are brought within the boarder of the regulatory legal framework. Effective
					regulations ensure that the industry upholds national and internationally recognised standards of
					compliance within the economic sector. </p>

				<p>Essentially, the purpose of legislation is to protect the role players and ensure operations are
					fair. The manifestation of such an industry as an online forum, as well as the increase of people’s
					reliance on technology presents real concerns as cyber-crimes escalate. The regulatory legal
					framework has become increasingly stagnant as it struggles to keep up with the continuous
					advancement of technology. This leaves players vulnerable, damaging the reputation of the industry
					as a whole. </p>

				<p>Regulatory bodies will benefit for participating in the Gron Digital platform. Existing regulated
					businesses may look to move to the Blockchain for the security and synergy it provides in relation
					to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Tax collection efforts accounts for the majority of their revenue and where most fraudulent
						activity can occur. Tax can be coded into our Smart Contract and paid directly to them without
						the need for manual intervention, costly audits and oversight procedures;
					</li>
					<li>All significant transactions will be recorded in the unchangeable online ledger offering
						guaranteed auditability and transparency;
					</li>
					<li>Digital signatures added to Smart Contracts by regulators can verify operators and their
						licenses for added assurance and security for players and regulators alike; and
					</li>
					<li>Smart Contracts can also have built-in dispute resolution terms, which reduce the need for
						regulatory intervention in conflict situations.
					</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
			
			
			<h2>8. Technology</h2>

			<!-- TODO: Add diagram of the database layer and description -->

			<p>Gaming systems generate enormous volumes of transactions at high speed. In physical casinos, games are
				autonomous, some are mechanical and others are physical. One of the challenges of online gaming
				platforms is to cater for these transactions in real time and across dispersed networks. As a result of
				hard coded limits on computations per block, the Ethereum Blockchain currently supports roughly 15
				transactions per second, which is insufficient. As usership on the platform grows it is expected that
				capacity will constrain speeds even further. This, along with the energy requirements and therefore gas
				costs associated with transacting in the distributed ledger, makes it impossible for gaming transactions
				to be accommodated on the chain. There are numerous initiatives to improve scalability and processing
				authorisations on the Blockchain such as moving away from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, Sharding and
				Multi-layer Noding such as Bitcoin’s Lightning network.</p>

			<p>Gron Digital will therefore develop its own scaling solution by processing most transactions off the
				chain through a separate platform. It is not necessary for every toss of a dice or spin of a wheel to be
				approved and therefore much of the calculations and data transfers will happen on operator computers,
				supplier servers or on gaming cloud servers. However, each party and bet will be assigned key labels or
				metadata which will allow for the accumulation of vast amounts of data that can classified and analysed
				with artificial intelligence to create a database that tracks and describes the activity within the
				marketplace.</p>
			
			<h2>9. Gron  Digital  Economics</h2>
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>9.1  GRO Currency and Revenue Streams</h3>

				<p>The Gron Digital platform will be utilized in several ways when making transactions and providing
					services by means of GRO as the digital currency. Perhaps one can think of the GRO as a casino chip.
					GRO utility tokens will enable individuals and organizations to play any game available on the
					Platform, to place bets with a sportsbook or play the lottery. All potential winnings will be paid
					out in GRO, however this is not limited to the GRO acting as a mere currency. Depending on the
					adopted role in the eco-system, participants will earn GRO and be rewarded for the services they
					provide on the Platform. </p>

				<p>The value proposition to Gron Digital as the custodian of the GRO economy is based on fees earned for
					services provided and capital appreciation of the GRO marketplace. Fees will be derived from Service
					Level Agreements between the parties and will be charged and recognised at regular intervals, either
					monthly or annually. Fees can be fixed or may fluctuate in proportion to the risk taken or
					complexity of the task being performed. </p>

				<p>Gron Digital will earn fees by:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Network-wide services (results, odds, RNG etc.);</li>
					<li>Continuous support improvements to the protocol;</li>
					<li>Development of modules and tools for Dapps;</li>
					<li>Subscription to the AI and database;</li>
					<li>GRO token appreciation due to increased scarcity over time;</li>
					<li>Revenue sharing from games supplied by Gron Digital subsidiaries;</li>
					<li>Partnerships and alliances within the Loyalty and Affiliate Programme.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>9.2 Token Intrinsic Value and Realisation</h3>

				<p>The appreciation of the GRO token over time is attributable to the three main functions of the token
					itself being:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Currency – GRO is a mode of exchange or legal tender within the GRO marketplace;</li>
					<li>Utility – GRO tokens entitle the holder to entertainment and the possibility of winning;</li>
					<li>Investment – GRO is a store of value which is expected to increase over time.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>These three functions have two separate methods of realisation or value disposal for the holders of
					GRO via two different exit strategies. </p>

				<ol>
					<li>As a means of trade, GRO can be used to purchase products and services within the Gron Digital
						marketplace. Operators will be able to pay suppliers for the use of their products. Players will
						be able to place bets in games using tokens and other stakeholders will be rewarded for their
						contributions to the eco-system by means of the cryptocurrency;
					</li>
					<li>After the ICO, the GRO token will be listed on all major crypto currency exchanges. Holders of
						GRO tokens will be able to easily and instantaneously convert their GRO into Bitcoin or Ether,
						any other Altcoin or exchange them for fiat currency. We estimate that growth in token value can
						be expected immediately after the ICO and should increase significantly within 6 months in line
						with the Project Development Roadmap.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>9.3 GRO Valuation</h3>

				<!-- TODO: Fig 1 : The token valuation approach as informed by Chris Burniske methodology -->

				<p>The funds to be raised in the coin offering represent the Founders’ best estimate of the maximum
					capital required to develop the gaming platform and roll it out to the existing betting industry in
					a sustainable way. This pool of available funds has been derived from the average historical price
					of Ethereum to ensure that sufficient funds are available to complete the project, but that late ICO
					entrants are not unduly diluted assuming ETH appreciative environment.</p>

				<p>In order to demonstrate that this Use of Funds will result in significant value accretion within a
					reasonable timeframe, the forecasted ICO issue price was compared to the discounted future value per
					circulating token of the estimated utility value of the underlying ecosystem, which is a proxy for
					the size of the asset base or alternatively GRO’s share of the Total Addressable Market. Given
					assumptions made in relation to the compound annual growth of online betting, Gron Digital’s
					penetration of this market and the saturation over time (which produces a conservative adoption
					profile), it can be shown that the present value of a GRO in ten years’ time, will be multiples
					(hundreds) of the initial offer price. This is true even if the GRO is assumed to remain sovereign
					bound initially and only expand to capture the global market after a period in excess of 10 years.
					In addition, the rate used to discount the future value reflects the deep risk-adjusted nature of
					the current cryptocurrency market which is assumed to be considerably more than a typical technology
					reliant VC start-up.</p>

				<p>The above valuation methodology reflects the fact that, in its purest form, GRO will be a utility
					token as it will facilitate participation in the online gambling industry. However, GRO will also
					generate value in the form of fees from its functionality as a technology platform as well as its
					ability to reward and incentivize industry stakeholders. These parallel value streams will
					contribute the overall future benefit of the token in the form of stored value appreciation.</p>

				<p>Quite apart from the quantitative characteristics of value mentioned above, from a qualitative
					perspective, intrinsic value can be shown particularly in relation to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the sheer size and growth potential of the online betting industry;</li>
					<li>the composition of the Gron Digital team and their advisers;</li>
					<li>the maturity of the existing group assets; and</li>
					<li>the ‘value add’ that the distributed Ethereum blockchain will bring to the mistrusted gambling
						industry.</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
			
			
			<h2>10. Competitive Analysis</h2>

			<p>The Blockchain domain has become increasingly relevant since the launch of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The growing demand for the Blockchain adoption continues and will continue as new ideas enter the market daily. The Blockchain has the potential to benefit multiple industries but is particularly evident in the clear synergy between the Blockchain and the Gambling industry.</p>

			<p>Gron Digital has several key advantages over its competitors. The founders of Gron Digital possess the relevant expertise in the industry:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>We are a legal Licensed Manufacturer and Service Provider to the Gaming Industry;</li>
				<li>We have the knowledge and hands-on experience in the Gaming and Betting domain;</li>
				<li>We have the IT infrastructure, necessary expertise, the management and the development team required
					to execute a project of this nature efficiently; and
				</li>
				<li>We have the Gambling and Betting certified products used in a production environment.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Gron Digital is not in the learning phase. We exhibit real-world experience, as well as existing
				functional systems and infrastructure which are currently servicing customers and the gaming industry.

			<p>Our accelerated development timeline means our MVP blueprint for the incorporation of our current systems
				with the Blockchain is already underway.</p>

			<h2>11. Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</h2>

			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>11.1  Token Distribution</h3>

				<p>The Gron Digital Platform will be based on its GRO utility token which will be listed via our Initial
					Coin Offering commencing on the 27th February 2018. A maximum of 950 000 000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty
					million) GRO utility tokens is anticipated to be issued on demand in the Pre-ICO and ICO
					phases. </p>

				<p>60% of the issued GRO, maximum 570 000 000 (Five Hundred and Seventy million tokens), will be
					allocated to the Gron Digital Pre-ICO and ICO phases for public participation. Pre-ICO is scheduled
					to run for 49 days, followed by 4 rounds of ICO with each round lasting for up to 14 days. These
					tokens are issued by GRO.sol contract. After all 4 rounds (or if the ICO ceiling of 570 000 000
					tokens is reached) the ICO will close. </p>

				<p>N.B. No unsold tokens will be issued therefore there will be no need to burn tokens at the end of the
					ICO. Tokens are issued as contributions are made.</p>

				<p>The GRO token is issued on demand as contribution takes place, i.e. as 0,6 GRO is swapped for either
					Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH). As this take place an additional 0.4 GRO is
					issued and allocated to Founders, Team Incentives, and Initial Bank Roll fund, thus a total of 1 GRO
					is issued. The additional 40% is issued by the GROVesting.sol contract. Founders and Team members
					will be locked in and will only be able to realise the value of their tokens based on a vesting
					schedule described below. </p>

				<p>It is important to note from the pie chart below that the Founders are only allocated 12% of the 1
					GRO mentioned above which is in line with industry norms. In addition, half of this vests with the
					Founders after 12 months and the other half after 24 months. This is also standard practice and
					ensures their commitment to the project and eliminates the possibility of tokens flooding the market
					leading to price depreciation. The other components of the 0.4 GRO are issued to Team members and
					Bonuses (12%) and the Initial Bank Roll (16%). Token issuances to the Team reduce the need for
					upfront cash to remunerate these individuals thereby</p>

				<!-- TODO: Fig 2 : Token Distribution-->

				<p>improving liquidity in the early phases of the start-up. This will have a dilution effect for other
					GRO holders after six months when these tokens vest but this is offset by the intrinsic value of the
					Token, given the payroll saving upfront.</p>

				<p>Unlike other ICO’s, gaming platforms have a significant initial float requirement to provide
					liquidity to the system for playing games on the Blockchain. This can be thought of as the Cashier
					Float in a casino where a high volume and turnover of transactions take place. Most of these Bank
					Roll tokens circulate within the internal marketplace or are held in storage and therefore do not
					affect the value of GRO tokens on the exchanges. </p>

				<h3>11.2 Soft and Hard Caps</h3>

				<p>GRO is a Capped ICO meaning it will only raise the amount of funds required to meet its objectives
					and no more. GRO is priced at 0.0001 ETH (or 1 ETH to 10,000 GRO) with discounts for early adopters.
					Based on project estimates, GRO Digital needs to raise a minimum of USD 1.1m failing which the
					project will not be viable and tokens sold to date will be returned and funds reimbursed to the
					contributors. This represents the ICO’s Soft Cap. The pie chart below shows how the fund raised will
					be used, half of which will go towards the development of the platform. </p>

				<!-- TODO: Fig 3 : Funds Allocation -->

				<p>Gron Digital aims to raise up to USD 8,500,000 which represents the Hard Cap and would be sufficient
					to develop, market and operate the platform on a sustainable basis. Depending on the average value
					of ETH over the ICO period, this would represent in the region of 85 to 100 million GRO tokens sold
					to the public and an additional 56 to 66 million for Bonuses, Incentives and the Bank Roll. </p>

			<h2>13 Conclusion</h2>

			<p>Gron Digital, together with other early adopters, seeks to radically change the way in which people
				transact and exchange value for goods and services online. We are firm believers in the power of the
				Blockchain and in Ethereum’s protocol and moreover we are confident that our specific knowledge,
				experience and capacity within the gaming industry stands us in good stead to become the market leading
				Gaming and Betting Platform. Through innovation and foresight, we will disrupt the online betting market
				in a meaningful and positive way and in doing so establish a more responsible and sustainable gaming
				ecosystem.</p>

			<p>Considering recent history and the mismanagement of corporations and institutions that have plagued the
				functioning and trust of society, we are excited to be a contributor to a more just and fair gaming
				ecosystem that will counteract monopolistic and centralised structures. The Blockchain is the ideal
				solution to address the fundamental issues of transparency and trust while at the same time improving
				our understanding of the players and operators that contribute to its success. The future of online
				Gaming and Betting has never looked so extraordinary and promising. Gron Digital hope to build a winning
				Gaming Platform which merges and connects various parties within this lucrative industry in order to
				ensure continuous growth and prosperity for all.</p>

			<p>The value proposition, offered to the industry through our utility tokens and Protocol, will provide the
				industry with an
				all-encompassing solution to various issues faced by the operators, players developers and regulators
				today. Through this detailed conceptual paper, we believe that our expertise and particular attention to
				the needs of the industry serve as powerful tools which enable us to bring this revolutionary Platform
				to the Gaming and Betting world.</p>
